Description: # CovFuzze Plot
        A python script to plot gene coverage and IP peaks with standard deviations calculated from multiple replicates. [covfʌzeɪ]
        
        Note: up until v0.1.3, coverage has been calculated using bedtools coverage -d. This considers gaps across positions as +1 reads. 
        Future versions will migrate to other (preferably faster) methods that don't count gaps.  
        
        usage: covfuzze [-h] [-g GENE] [-o OUT] --bams BAMS [BAMS ...] --bed 
                                 BED [--gtf GTF] [-p PEAKS] -l LABELS [LABELS ...]
                                 [-n NSUBPLOTS] [--normalize] [--scale]
        
        ## dependencies:
        - numpy, tested with 1.11.1
        - pysam, tested with 0.9.1
        - pandas, tested with 0.18.1
        - seaborn, tested with 0.7.1 
        - matplotlib, tested with 2.0.2 - requires macosx backend to run on mac and may have issues with pip install - try conda 
        - pybedtools, tested with 0.7.10 - requires bedtools available in path
        It requires quite a bit of memory to run with whole genome bam files. If running on a cluster, recommend allocating 200GB. 
        
        ## installation
        Easiest way:
        ```
        pip install covfuzze
        ```
        If you have issues with dependencies, try installing them separately with conda or as appropriate for your OS 
        
        ## required arguments:
        ```
          -o OUT, --out OUT     output prefix (incl. dir) 
          --bams BAMS [BAMS ...] 
                                bam files (separated by spaces) 
          --bed BED             bed file for region(s) of interest  
          -l LABELS [LABELS ...], --labels LABELS [LABELS ...] 
                                labels associated with bams - if replicates, use same 
                                labels
        ```
        ## optional arguments:
        ```
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit 
          -g GENE, --gene GENE  gene name (default = GeneDoe) 
          --gtf GTF             gtf file for gene to plot cds as shaded regions separated by exon
          -p PEAKS, --peaks PEAKS 
                                bed file with peaks
          -n NSUBPLOTS, --nsubplots NSUBPLOTS 
                                number of subplots- bams will be split evenly based on 
                                the order given (default = 1) 
          --normalize           normalize by gene length/summed coverage (default = False)
          --scale               scale y axis separately for each subplot (default = False)
        
        ```
        
        ## Example:
        ```
        covfuzze -o $outdir/$prefix --bams 
            alignments/sample_1_Input.sample.star.bam alignments/sample_1_IP.sample.star.bam 
            alignments/sample_2_Input.sample.star.bam alignments/sample_2_IP.sample.star.bam 
            alignments/sample_3_Input.sample.star.bam alignments/sample_3_IP.sample.star.bam 
            --bed ${gene}_exons.bed 
            -l sample_Input sample_IP sample_Input sample_IP sample_Input sample_IP 
            --gene ${gene} -n 1 --scale
        ```
